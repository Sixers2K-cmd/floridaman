🌴 <b>Our Story:</b> Florida Man was born out of a love for all things Florida. From the swaying palm trees to the crystal-clear waters, our state is more than just a location—it’s a lifestyle. As a team of passionate Floridians, we wanted to share our enthusiasm with the world. So, we scoured the beaches, explored the Everglades, and chatted with the locals to curate a collection that embodies the magic of Florida.
